# Code Decks

An Anki-like app but focusing on code snippets.

## Development Environment

### VS Code Configuration

- Install extension, `pucelle.run-on-save`
- Install [`autoflake`](https://pypi.org/project/autoflake/)
    - Personally, I installed `autoflake` "globally" using [pipx](https://pypi.org/project/pipx/). That way, no further VS Code configuration is required aside from what is here in the repo, `./.vscode/settings.json`.
